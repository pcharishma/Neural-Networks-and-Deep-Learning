Neural Networks and Deep Learning, taught by Andrew Ng

In this course, we can learn the foundations of deep learning. 
- Understand the major technology trends driving Deep Learning
- Be able to build, train and apply fully connected deep neural networks 
- Know how to implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks 
- Understand the key parameters in a neural network's architecture 

This course also teaches us how Deep Learning actually works, rather than presenting only a cursory or surface-level description. So after completing it, we will be able to apply deep learning to a your own applications. This is the first course of the Deep Learning Specialization.
